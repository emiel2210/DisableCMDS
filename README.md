#What Is QuickJoinMsg???-
This plugin basically just disables commands for all normal players on the server so you can have an adventure or vanilla style server, and once the ability to set commands that players can still run is added it'll be perfect for a minigames server! Also please note that DisableCMDS only supports ImagicalMine and that although I try my best I do not always get the time to test this completely so there may be some bugs, report them to me and I will to and fix them as soon as possible - Enjoy :)
